<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to Problem Set 1! There are two “problem” exercises and one extended Stata exercise. You’ll need to submit three things on Blackboard: a problem set, log file, <em>and</em> a do-file.</p>
<p>Note that there are superscripted numbers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> throughout the page that provide additional information/suggestions to help you out.</p>
