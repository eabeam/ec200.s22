<p>Suppose I asked you to recreate your analysis from our last lab. How
long would it take you? If you used a do-file, you would just have to
click a button, because your analysis would be replicable. We’re going
to learn about the glory of do-files and a few other descriptive
statistics tricks.</p>
<p>The instant gratification of the Command window is tempting, but getting
comfortable with do-files will save you lots of time, make collaboration
easier, and reduce errors!</p>

<h3>Aside: Bad documentation, big problems</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For an economist, the ﬁve most terrifying words in the English language are: I can’t replicate your results.But for economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoﬀ of Harvard, there are seven even more terrifying ones: I think you made an Excel error.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/forget-excel-this-was-reinhart-and-rogoffs-biggest-mistake/275088/">Matthew O’Brien, The Atlantic (18 April 2013)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A summary from <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646">The Conversation, (22 April, 2013)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reinhart and Rogoff’s work showed average real economic growth slows (a 0.1% decline) when a country’s debt rises to more than 90% of gross domestic product (GDP) – and this 90% figure was employed repeatedly in political arguments over high-profile austerity measures…</p>
<p>The most serious was that, in their Excel spreadsheet, Reinhart and Rogoff had not selected the entire row when averaging growth figures: they omitted data from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark.</p>
<p>In other words, they had accidentally only included 15 of the 20 countries under analysis in their key calculation.</p>
<p>When that error was corrected, the “0.1% decline” data became a 2.2% average increase in economic growth.</p>
<p>So the key conclusion of a seminal paper, which has been widely quoted in political debates in North America, Europe Australia and elsewhere, was invalid.</p>

<div id="do-files-and-the-do-file-editor" class="section level3">
<h3>Do-files and the do-file editor</h3>
<p>You can get pretty far in Stata relying on the Command and Review
window, but we may want a record of the commands we want to run for our
analysis. One thing that makes Stata different from a program like Excel
is that you can create do-files, essentially small programs that will
run your analysis again and again, in exactly the same way. For
econometric analysis this is CRUCIAL.</p>
<p>A do-file can be written in any text file and then saved with the
extension <code>.do</code>, but we’ll use the do-file editor. You can start a new do-file by
clicking on the do-file button. Or, you can open the do-file template.</p>
<p>The do-file editor is where we will write our programs, and it has some
nice color coding to help us avoid mistakes. For your problem sets and
papers, you must ALWAYS submit a do-file along with your results. Some
people will like to practice in the Command window and then copy the
commands they’re satisfied with to the do-file, while others will prefer
to work entirely in the do-file. It’s your call, though the second one
is a little less risky.</p>
<div id="comment-comment-comment" class="section level4">
<h4>Comment, comment, comment</h4>
<p>Do-files are used to record your past work and possibly to share your
work with others. It’s important to properly <strong>document</strong> your work
using comments. There are three ways to comment</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Comment the whole line with an asterisk</p></li>
<li><p>Comment the whole line or part of a line with two forward slashes (<code>//</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Use slash-asterisk to open (<code>/*</code>) and close (<code>*/</code>) a comment section</p></li>
</ol>
<p><code>{{&lt; figure library="true" src="stata-comment.png" width=400 title="" &gt;}}</code></p>
<p>The do-file editor will turn all your comments green so you don’t get
confused.</p>

<div id="programming-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>Programming tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Put everything in a do-file!</strong> An important feature of any good
research project is that the results should be reproducible. For
Stata the easiest way to do this is to create a text file that lists
all your commands in order, so anyone can re-run all your Stata work
on a project anytime. Such text files that are produced within Stata
or linked to Stata are called do-files, because they have an
extension .do (like <code>intro_exercise.do</code>). These files feed commands
directly into Stata without you having to type or copy them into the
command window.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re just about done with the analysis for your research
paper. While working on the final regression, you discover that one
of your variables wasn’t cleaned properly, and you need to drop some
outliers from the data. Do you correct it and redo everything from
scratch? Could you even do that? How long would it take?</p>
<p>With a set of do-files, all you have to do is correct the variable
early in the code, and re-run everything. If your code is quick, it
will take just a few minutes. Easy!</p>
<p>An added bonus is that having do-files makes it very easy to fix
your typos, re-order commands, and create more complicated chains of
commands that wouldn’t work otherwise. You can now quickly reproduce
your work, correct it, adjust it, and build on it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Log your results.</strong> Maintaining logs can help you quickly retrieve
results and serve as a record of past work in case you accidentally
overwrite commands. Logs contain the commands <em>and</em> the results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Never overwrite your original files.</strong> A good do-file structure
starts with your original, raw data, then cleans and analyzes it to
get your final results. A “master” do-file can piece all these
together.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicability is key.</strong> Your code should be replicable to someone
else who picks up your raw files and code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment, comment, comment!</strong> Clear commenting is essential to help
others understand your code and to remember what you did.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="finding-new-commands" class="section level3">
<h3>Finding new commands</h3>
<p>One of the strengths of Stata is that complicated processes can be
completed with simple commands. One of its weaknesses is that it’s not
always obvious what those specific commands are. In our problem sets and
your research paper, you will (I promise) have to calculate or estimate
something in a way we haven’t covered.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stata help file: <code>help command</code></p></li>
<li><p>Search Stata documentation: <code>finidit keyword</code></p></li>
<li><p>Google the thing you are trying to do: <em>i.e.: make scatterplot
Stata, turn rows into columns Stata, cluster standard errors Stata,
etc.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>What do I submit?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your written up answers to exercise questions (1) - (12). This can be typed or written out then scanned (or photographed), in any reasonable format.</li>

<div id="questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download <a href="materials/acs2014_all.dta"><code>acs2014_all.dta</code></a> and <a href="materials/labtemplate_f21.do"><code>labtemplate.do</code></a> by clicking the links.</p></li>
<li><p>Move these files to wherever you store your class materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <code>labtemplate_f21.do</code> and run it. Does it work? Probably not! Fix it.</p></li>
<li><p>Drop some variables we don’t need right now: <code>gq</code>, <code>serial</code>, and <code>hhwt</code>. How
many variables remain?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the age distribution of the sample? Specifically, report the
mean, median, minimum, and maximum age of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>Because very young workers might be still in school, drop anyone in
your sample who is less than 23 years old. (Maintain this sample
restriction for the rest of the lab). How many people are left in
your sample?</p></li>
<li><p>Generate a new variable, <code>lt35</code> that is equal to one if a person is
less than 35 years old and 0 otherwise. What is the mean of <code>lt35,</code> and what is its interpretation?</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <code>tabstat</code> command, find the average income and wages for those under age 35 and those at least age 35. How does it compare to median income and wages for each group?</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <code>tabstat</code> command, find the average income and wages for men and women.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several reasons why men might earn more than women. Suppose you hypothesized that
that men have completed more education than women; and workers with higher education levels earn more. We will test this in two ways.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First, generate a variable equal to one if a person has
completed at least some post-secondary education, and zero
otherwise. What is the mean of this variable?</p></li>
<li><p>What share of men have at least some post-secondary education?
What about women?</p></li>
<li><p>We can also see if gender-wage gaps are bigger for lower vs.
higher-educated workers. For those without post-secondary
education, what is the average wage gap? For those with
post-secondary education, what is the average wage gap?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Name <strong>two</strong> additional reasons that may explain why men’s
income is higher than women’s income on average. How would you
test each one? <em>You do not have to actually do this test, just
describe in as much detail as possible. You can assume you have
additional data beyond what is provided here.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Make two histograms, one of the income distribution for men
and one of the income distribution for women. Make sure the
y-axis indicates the “fraction” of individuals, not the density.
Copy and paste it into your responses.</p></li>
