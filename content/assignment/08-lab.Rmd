**[Print-friendly pdf](../08-lab.pdf)**

It's our final lab of the semester! :raised_hands: :trophy: :dancer: :clap:

## Materials {#materials .unnumbered}

- [`voucher.dta`](../materials/voucher.dta)

- Do-file template [`labtemplate_f21.do`](../materials/labtemplate_f21.do) 


## Objectives {#objectives .unnumbered}

By the end of this lab, you should be able to complete the following
tasks in Stata:

-   Estimate instrumental variable specifications and interpret them.

-   Output regression results using `outreg2`

## Key commands  {#key-commands .unnumbered}

### Conducting instrumental variables regressions with `ivregress` 

We can estimate an instrumental variables regression with `ivregress` 

General form: 
```
ivregress estimator depvar [varlist1] (varlist2 = varlist_iv) [if] [in] [weight] [, options]
```

- `estimator` is where we will type `2sls`
- `depvar` is your dependent variable
- You can include other explanatory variables before or after the parentheses, `[varlist1]
- In the parentheses, write you endogenous ($x$) then your instrument ($z$) - these can be lists! 
- The rest of it is just as you're used to 

Example: 

To estimate the following two-stage least squares equation: 
$$ rent = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \widehat{hsngval} + \beta_2 pcturban + u$$
where $\widehat{hsngval}$ is predicted from the following first-stage equation
$$ hsngval = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 faminc + \alpha_2 pcturban + v $$ 

``` 
webuse hsng2

ivregress 2sls rent  (hsngval = faminc ) pcturban, robust

```

You can add `, first` to report the first-stage results: 
```
`ivregress 2sls rent  (hsngval = faminc ) pcturban, robust first`
```

### Outputting your results with `outreg2` 

We are very good at reading raw Stata output. But, raw stata output has no place in our papers. How do we make it pretty? There are lots of ways, including `putexcel`, which lets you create customizable excel tables with your outputs (good for descriptive statistics), and `estout`, which does the same thing but is more regression oriented. 

Personally, I like `outreg2`, because it's easy to set up and use. So that's what we'll use! 

`outreg2` is a user-created package, which means you have to install it: 

```
ssc install outreg2
````

You only have to do this once. 

You'll run `outreg2` after estimating a regression. It takes your results and saves them to a table. You can run it multiple time and generate columns of results within the same excel sheet, which is pretty handy! The general format of outreg2 is this: 

```
// You can copy and paste this into stata, and it should work! But note that it will save to your working directory

sysuse auto,clear

// Specification 1
regress mpg foreign weight headroom trunk length turn displacement
outreg2 using myfile.xls, replace 

// Specification 2  (add on)
regress mpg foreign weight headroom trunk length turn displacement,robust
outreg2 using myfile.xls, append 
```
 
 You can customize, with lots of options! (see `help outreg2`, or check out [these resources](https://thedatahall.com/stata-outreg2-part1/))
 
What sort of things? 

 - Export directly to Word
    - `outreg2 using myfile, word replace`
 - Add summary statistics and p-values 
    - See [here](https://thedatahall.com/reporting-publication-style-regression-output-in-stata-part-2/) for more details
 - Add notes
    - `outreg2 using myfile, addnote(Dummy variables not shown)`
 - Report only some variables
    - `outreg2 using myfile, keep(mpg foreign)`
 - Modify number of decimal places
   - `outreg2 using myfile, dec(5)`
 - You can use a loop to make a whole set of columns!
 
 An example:
 
 ``` 
 
  sysuse auto,clear
  local r "replace"
    forval num=1/5 {
        regress mpg weight headroom if rep78==`num'
        sum mpg if rep78 == `num'
        local mean = `r(mean)'
        outreg2 using myfile.xls, `r' keep(headroom) title("Sample Graph") nocons addtext("Rep78", `num') addstat("Mean", `mean') auto(2) bracket
    
    local r "append"
    }

```

## Exercises



Today we're going to work with [`voucher.dta`](../materials/voucher.dta), a data set of student
performance from Rouse (1998). She measures the impact of private school
vouchers on student achievement. The final measure of student
performance we're interested in is `mnce`, their math test scores in
1994 (after up to four years in the private school). We also have some
measures of baseline performance, their math test score in 1990
(`mnce90`). The variable `choiceyrs` is the number of years enrolled in
a private school, and `selectyrs` is the number of years a student was
*selected* to receive a voucher to fund enrolling in a private school.\

1.  In your do-file, start a log and open `voucher.dta`.

2.  Summarize your data. Of the 990 students in the sample, how many were never awarded a
    voucher? How many had a voucher for all four years? How many
    actually attended a choice school for four years?

3.  Predict the relationship between choice school attendance and math
    scores by regressing math scores `mnce` (dependent variable) on
    number of years enrolled in a choice school `choiceyrs` (independent
    variable). What do you find? Is this what you expect? What happens
    if you add in the variables `black`, `hispanic`, and `female`? Write
    your results in equation form.

4.  Why might `choiceyrs` be endogenous? Explain:

5.  Now, estimate a regression of $choiceyrs$ (dependent variable) on
    $selectyrs$ (independent variable), including race/ethnicity and
    gender controls. Why is this a reasonable choice of an instrument?
    What is the F-statistic on `selectyrs`? (*Hint: You can use the
    `testparm` command for a hypothesis test with just one coefficient*)

6.  Based on the previous regression, use the `predict` command to
    generate a predicted $\widehat{choiceyrs}$. Estimate the regression
    of $mnce$ on $\widehat{choiceyrs}$, including race/ethnicity and
    gender controls. Write the estimated equation. How does your result
    compare to your OLS estimate?)

7. Re-estimate a regression of $mnce$ (dependent variable) on
    $choiceyrs$ (independent variable) using $selectyrs$ as an
    instrument for $choiceyrs$. However, this time, estimate the
    equation in one command line using `ivregress 2sls`. How do your
    results change, if at all?

8. Repeat your IV analysis, but this time include a control for
    baseline achievement by adding $mnce90$. Write the results in
    equation form below. Do you find these results convincing? Explain.

9. We can also use multiple instruments for multiple endogenous
    variables. The variables $choiceyrs1$, $choiceyrs2$, etc. are dummy
    variables indicating the different number of years a student could
    have been in a choice school. Similarly, $selectyrs1$, $selectyrs2$,
    etc. have a similar definition, but for being selected from the
    lottery.

    Estimate the following equation using IV. $$\begin{split}
    mnce &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 choiceyrs_1 + \beta_2 choiceyrs_2 + \beta_3 choiceyrs_3 + \beta_4 choiceyrs_4 + \\
    &  \beta_5 black + \beta_6 hispanic + \beta_7 female + \beta_8 mnce90 + u
    \end{split}$$

10. Finally, go back through your regressions in your do-file. After
    each regression (there should be six: OLS without controls, OLS with
    controls, IV by hand, IV using `ivregress`, IV with $mnce90$, and IV
    with multiple instruments), add a line of code to output the results
    to a word or excel file using `outreg2`.

    **Include a table with your results with your submission** - there
    should be six columns in one table. *Note that you can use the
    `append` option to add each regression as a new column, rather than
    a new file.*
