## Purpose:

- To practice generating constructive criticism for imperfect work
- To link what we've learned in class to an original analysis
- To generate useful feedback for your peers

## Key Elements 
1. Summary of the paper – to convey to the editor that you understand the paper.

2. Major comments
  - Big-picture things that the author could make to improve the paper
  - 2-4 major comments is sufficient
  - Not enough to criticize!
3.  Minor comments:
  - Clarifying questions, areas that are unclear
  - Small changes the author could make to improve the paper – add an additional covariate, try adjusting the specification, etc.
  - Depending on paper, you could have just a few, or you could have a lot
  - Don’t copy edit the paper!
  
## What should this look like? 

- All the components above
  - At least 2 major comments (substantial suggestions)
  - At least 3 minor comments (minor suggestions)
- Will probably be 1-2 pages 
  - 3 pages = overkill, < 1 page, dig in deeper! 
- Written in collegial tone

## Submission 
 - Upload on BB 
 - *And* send directly to your partner 
 
 Note that I'm assigning referee partners at an individual level, not at a paper level. If you are working with a partner, each of you will complete a referee report, and your paper will receive two reviews.
