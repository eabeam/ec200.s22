**Due date is rolling: your slides are due the day of your assigned presentation. Because we're running out of class, we can't do extensions!** 

## Overview 

Let's share our work! You'll prepare and deliver a 6-8 minute presentation of your paper, with accompanying slides. This will be one presentation per paper. If you are working with a partner, it should be one set of slides, with both members contributing to the creation and delivery. 


Our objectives here are the following: 

1. To communicate the key elements off your paper clearly and concisely (which, in turn, will help advance your paper)
2. To share and receive feedback on areas of improvement before finalizing your papers
3. To share with your peers and learn what each of you has been working on!



## Guidelines for presentation

Your presentation should cover the main elements of your paper: 

  1. Introduction 
  2. Research questions 
  3. Background/motivation/related literature 
  4. Data
  5. Empirical strategy
  6. Results 
  7. Limitations/discussion 
  8. Conclusion
  
- It doesn't need to be scripted, but you should have practiced, such that your presentation flows smoothly. 
- Slides should serve as a guide, not a substitute for your narration, so you should avoid reading directly off your slides
- It should be between 6 and 8 minutes. **I will cut you off at 8 minutes. I will do it.** 

## Example 

`r blogdown::shortcode("slides")`

Additional student examples are available on Blackboard (see **Gated Resources**)

## Deliverables and due dates

Your due date is the day you signed up for via Doodle poll: **December 06, 08, or 10 at 2:20pm**

 **On Blackboard:** Submit a copy of your slides **before** your presentation.
