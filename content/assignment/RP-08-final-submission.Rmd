## Research Paper - Final Submission 


Research papers are fairly formulaic, and that's a good thing - it helps readers know where to look for information, depending on what they want to get out of it. 


## What should I submit? 

Your paper is due at **11:59pm December 13**. *I cannot accept extensions*, as there are external grading deadlines I need to meet. 

You should submit the following: 

 - Final paper in pdf or docx format 
 - Stata do-file with all analysis you conducted 
 - Stata log file with results for analysis conducted in your do-file. 
 
I will grade your papers following the rubric. If you would like me to share comments, you must *opt-in* by filling out the [feedback survey](https://forms.gle/kxGcNvFzzGtduGQ99). If you do not fill it out, you will not receive feedback! 


## Elements of your research paper 

A reasonable approach is to pull up an academic paper you're citing that is in the economics literature and see how it's structured. However, here is more general guide. While a good paper
will meet these criteria, please note that, this is not a grading
rubric!
