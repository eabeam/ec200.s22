<h2>Research Paper - Final Submission</h2>
<p>Research papers are fairly formulaic, and that’s a good thing - it helps readers know where to look for information, depending on what they want to get out of it.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-should-i-submit" class="section level2">
<h2>What should I submit?</h2>
<p>Your paper is due at <strong>11:59pm December 13</strong>. <em>I cannot accept extensions</em>, as there are external grading deadlines I need to meet.</p>
<p>You should submit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final paper in pdf or docx format</li>
<li>Stata do-file with all analysis you conducted</li>
<li>Stata log file with results for analysis conducted in your do-file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will grade your papers following the rubric. If you would like me to share comments, you must <em>opt-in</em> by filling out the <a href="https://forms.gle/kxGcNvFzzGtduGQ99">feedback survey</a>. If you do not fill it out, you will not receive feedback!</p>

<div id="elements-of-your-research-paper" class="section level2">
<h2>Elements of your research paper</h2>
<p>A reasonable approach is to pull up an academic paper you’re citing that is in the economics literature and see how it’s structured. However, here is more general guide. While a good paper
will meet these criteria, please note that, this is not a grading
rubric!</p>
