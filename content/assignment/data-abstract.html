<div id="objective" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this submission is to help you front-load finding and
setting up the data set(s) you need for your analysis, so that you have
all the information you need to develop a careful empirical strategy and
analysis plan for your paper (and paper proposal).</p>
</div>
<div id="components" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>The data abstract should consist of two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A write-up (roughly one page) of your chosen research question. It
should clearly state your research question, discuss the data sets
you will include, and list the variables from those data sets you
plan to include. Think of this taking one of your ideas from your
idea proposal, revising it to reflect any feedback, and adding
specifics about the data and variables you will use in your
analysis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Your research question should be clearly stated, and it should
be answerable with the data you describe.</p></li>
<li><p>Be clear about everything we need to know regarding your data.
Where is it from? What years are available? What
countries/groups are included?</p></li>
<li><p>Be specific about what variables you will include in your
analysis. These variables should be summarized in your summary
statistics table. If you weren’t able to get all of them up and
running, discuss what additional variables you plan to add and
where you will get them from.</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, any data sets you use will need to be cited in your
references/bibliography section, so include those citations at
the bottom of your document as well.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A “summary statistics” table that includes the basic descriptive
statistics that will be relevant to your analysis. Ultimately, this
table will probably be the first table in your final paper. It
should be <strong>formatted nicely</strong> (i.e., not copied directly out of Stata)
with easy-to-interpret variables names and column headers, and it
will likely include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of observations</p></li>
<li><p>Means and standard deviations of your dependent variable(s)</p></li>
<li><p>Means and standard deviations of your key independent
variable(s)</p></li>
<li><p>If you are comparing two (or more) groups, you will likely want
to report means separately for each group.</p></li>
<li><p>Any other details that might be relevant to your data (i.e.
number of states, number of years, number of households, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
