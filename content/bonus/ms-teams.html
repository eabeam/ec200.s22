<h2>EC200 Norms for Teams</h2>
<p>We’re a small(ish) class, which means we can a little flexible on norms. Also, as we learn what works best, we may favor some methods of collaborating over others.</p>
<p>Monday and Wednesday will be synchronous classes. We will meet on Teams. You will receive an invite in your e-mail.</p>
<div id="recording" class="section level3">
<h3>Recording</h3>
<p>I plan to record Monday and Wednesday sessions and make them available on Teams.</p>
</div>
<div id="cameras" class="section level3">
<h3>Cameras</h3>
<p>We will feel more like humans if we can see each other. I encourage you to keep your camera on during class sessions, but it is not required. Of course, if you need to use the bathroom, grab a snack, wrangle a cat – feel free to shut it off briefly. If you don’t want to feel like we’re all hanging out in your bedroom, feel free to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-your-background-for-a-teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780">change/blur</a> your background. If you are not comfortable with your camera on, I’d appreciate it if you’d load up picture or avatar.</p>
</div>
<div id="chathand" class="section level3">
<h3>Chat/hand</h3>
<p>During lectures/demonstrations, please feel free to use the chat as a place to ask questions, or raise your hand. I will also ask questions of you, and the best way to respond is with the chat or hand, depending on your preference.</p>
</div>
<div id="microphone" class="section level3">
<h3>Microphone</h3>
<p>In general, please keep your microphone muted unless you are speaking.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-you-have-technical-problems" class="section level3">
<h3>What if you have technical problems?</h3>
<p>Don’t worry, just do your best to get back online. If it’s a total loss, you can catch up w/ the recordings afterward.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-i-have-technical-problems" class="section level3">
<h3>What if <em>I</em> have technical problems?</h3>
<p>My internet is usually okay, but sometimes my computer gets overexcited and just cannot cope. If I drop out, just wait and I’ll rejoin as quickly as I can.
If for some reason Teams crashes/explodes, we’ll switch to Zoom. I’ll post a permanent link on Teams to our “back-up” location.<br />
If for some reason all is truly lost, I’ll send an announcement, we’ll end class early and resume in our next session .</p>

<h2>Rusty on Teams?</h2>
<p>ETS has a good <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/it/kb/article/teams/">overview</a> of the basics behind MS Teams, with a specific focus on <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/it/kb/article/class-teams-for-students/">how students are likely to use it</a></p>
