<p>*Guidelines and tips for papers**</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Active voice</p></li>
<li><p>First-person singular/plural (as appropriate)</p></li>
<li><p>Paper divided numbered, labeled sections.</p></li>
<li><p>No personal opinions</p></li>
<li><p>Present tense</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract &amp; Title</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Descriptive title included</p></li>
<li><p>200 words or less abstract</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>States your research question clearly</p></li>
<li><p>Explains what economic theory says about the potential answers to
your questions, and/or defines clear hypotheses that you test</p></li>
<li><p>Describes why your topic is important</p></li>
<li><p>Describes what you do</p></li>
<li><p>Describes what you find</p></li>
<li><p>Describe how it contributes</p></li>
<li><p>Reader can infer all main points of paper just from introduction</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation/Literature Review</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Includes papers that have answered your research question (or
similar research question)</p></li>
<li><p>Research results described in present tense (“Smith finds,” not
“Smith found”)</p></li>
<li><p>Papers linked clearly to their contribution (as relates to your
research question)</p>
<ul>
<li>For example,</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology/Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data source described and cited</p></li>
<li><p>Population model written out</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use proper equation notation (betas, u, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Use appropriate subscripts (<em>i, t, y, etc)</em></p></li>
<li><p>All relevant variables explained/defined</p></li>
<li><p>Use “real names” to describe variables when possible (ie use
<em>female</em> for women, not <em>w1</em>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Describe your methodology. Are you estimating a model using OLS? If
so, say so.</p></li>
<li><p>Correct standard errors: robust? Clustered? Something else?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>When using categorical/dummy variables, what is your omitted
category? Make sure you know and that it’s clear.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the units of your measures?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is that percent or percentage points?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In most contexts, about 3 places past the decimal point is right,
but it depends on the magnitudes. If you really want to be precise,
set and stick to a reasonable number of significant digits. There’s
no place for a number like 0.05403823 or 0.0000000 in your tables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tables and Figures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tables should be properly formatted. That is, they should be made in
Excel (or LaTeX) and NEVER copied and pasted out of Stata</p></li>
<li><p>Variables should be described using real words. Ie, “number of
children,” not “numchld.”</p></li>
<li><p>Tables and figures should be numbered (Table 1, Table 2, etc…
Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) and should also be given a title. Refer to
tables by their numbers in the text.</p></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>References</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use footnotes rather than endnotes</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of your paper, include list of references cited</p></li>
<li><p>You can format using APA, MLA, or Chicago style</p>
<ul>
<li>Citation Owl or Google Scholar will do it for you</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In-text, cite with author and year (Author, Year; Author, Year) or
(Author Year, Author Year)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working with data</strong></p>
<p>If you’re working with people</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the age range you want in your sample?</p></li>
<li><p>What years of data do you need?</p></li>
<li><p>If in the US, do you want citizens, or do you also want to include
immigrants?</p></li>
<li><p>If dealing with labor force variables, do you want all people of
working age, all those who are in the labor force, or all who are
employed?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Checklist for papers:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>First-person active voice! (I estimate a regression, <strong>NOT</strong> “A
regression is estimated”)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Single-authored paper first person singular, “I.” (You’re not
the queen!)</p></li>
<li><p>Joint-authored paper first person plural, “we.”</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t believe me? Check out any economics paper published in the
past 20 years. There’s <em>some</em> variation in I vs. we, but <em>all</em>
use active voice.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Paper divided numbered, labeled sections.</p></li>
<li><p>At the back of your mind, when motivating your paper, ask “what is
the link to economics”?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If studying discrimination, what does economic theory tell us
about why discrimination exists/persists</p></li>
<li><p>If studying stock market returns, what do economic models tell
us about our ability to predict returns?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A research paper is not an essay!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Personal opinions don’t have a place</p></li>
<li><p>Sources should be primarily academic (peer-reviewed journals,
working papers, etc.), maybe some non-academic sources for
motivation only</p></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract &amp; Title</strong></p>

including motivation, empirical strategy, findings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Describe the data you use, where did it come from? If you didn’t

use equation editor. Make it look nice. Don’t forget the error term</p></li>

so, say so.</p></li>
