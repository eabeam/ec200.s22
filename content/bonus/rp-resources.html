<h2>Getting started with IPUMS</h2>
<p>You will need an account to use IPUMS, and there can be some wait time for approval. So it’s a good idea to set up your account <em>before</em> you need your data, so you don’t get slowed down.</p>

<div id="suggested-topics" class="section level2">
<h2>Suggested topics</h2>
<p>Grab and go, or iterate from here.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>How has COVID-19 affected <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/17/upshot/women-workforce-employment-covid.html">mothers’ labor supply</a> in the United States?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>How do spouses negotiate in a crisis? Are there gender differences in how parents’ labor supply changed in light of COVID-19, and did these changes differ in states with more or less intensive school closures? What does this tell us about household bargaining?</p></li>
<li><p>Did generous unemployment benefits keep Americans from returning to work post-COVID? You can consider state-level variation in unemployment benefit policies and unemployment rates using the CPS.</p></li>
<li><p>How did the Affordable Care Act affect access to health insurance in states with and without Medicaid expansions? (See <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.21961">Courtemanche et al. (2016)</a>, who use the ACS).</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatedly, how did Medicaid expansion affect consumer health care expenditures? You could use the same distinction between states that did and did not participate in Medicaid expansions, but instead use the <a href="https://meps.ipums.org/meps/">MEPS</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minimum wages: What is the impact of minimum wages on <em>{something}</em>? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>**What is the effect of minimum wages on teen employment? For this, you would want state-level minimum wages over time. You can use the CPS to calculate teenage employment rates over time and get data on other factors that might affect employment. See Solon (1985) and Castillo-Freeman and Freeman (1992).</p></li>
<li><p>**Do minimum wages alleviate poverty? The ACS should have the information that you need. You would also need data on state-level minimum wages over time. See Neumark and Wascher (1995).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>** What factors might explain racial/ethnic and gender differences in employment and wages? For example, Holzer (1991) reviewed the evidence on the “spatial mismatch hypothesis” to explain differences in employment rates between blacks and whites. Korenman and Neumark (1992) examined the effects of childbearing on women’s wages, while Hersch and Stratton (1997) looked at the effects of household responsibilities on men’s and women’s wages. <em>Push harder than just identifying whether gender or racial/ethnic wage gaps exist (they do!).</em></p></li>
<li><p>** Do parental consent laws increase the teenage birthrate? You can use
state level data for this: either a time series for a given state
or, even better, a panel data set of states. Do the same laws reduce
abortion rates among teenager? The <em>Statistical Abstract of the
United States</em> contains all kinds of state-level data. Levine,
Trainor, and Zimmerman (1996) studied the effects of abortion
funding restrictions on similar outcomes. Other factors, such as
access to abortions, may affect teen birth an abortion rate.</p></li>

### Adapted from Wooldridge
The following suggested topics are taken from Wooldridge. These can be
used as a starting point for your own idea generation. You can use these
questions as is, you can focus on a specific aspect of a question, or
you can add an additional subgroup or covariate to extend the analysis.

1.  

2.  Do your own "audit" study to test for discrimination in hiring (by
    race, gender, some other dimension). Have pairs of equally qualified
    friends, say, one male and one female, apply for local job openings
    in local bars or restaurants. You can provide them with phony
    resumes that give each the same experience and background, where the
    only difference is gender (or race, or something else). Then, track
    who gets the interviews (and/or job offers). Neumark (1996)
    described one such study conducted in Philadelphia. A variant would
    be to test whether general physical attractiveness or a specific
    characteristic, such as being obese or having visible tattoos or
    body piercings, plays a role in hiring decisions. You would want to
    use the same gender in the matched pairs, and it may not be easy to
    get volunteers for such a study.


4. 



    There is also recent interest in the effects of "abstinence only"
    sex education curricula. one can again use state-level panel data,
    or maybe even panel data at the school district level, to determine
    the effects of abstinence-only approaches to sex education on
    various outcomes, including rates of sexually transmitted diseases
    and teen birth rates.

6.  Do change in traffic laws affect traffic fatalities? McCarthy (1994)
    contains an analysis of monthly time series data for the state of
    California. A set of dummy variables can be used to indicate the
    months in which certain laws were in effect. The file TRAFFIC2
    contains the data used by McCarthy. An alternative is to obtain a
    panel data set on states in the United States, where you can exploit
    variation in laws across states, as well as across time.
    Freeman (2007) is a good example of a state-level analysis, using 25
    years of data that straddle changes in various state drunk driving,
    seat belt, and speed limit laws.

7.  Use panel data to study the effects of various economic policies on
    regional economic growth. Studying the effects of taxes and spending
    is natural, but other policies may be of interest. For example,
    Craig, Jackson, and Thomson (2007) study the effects of Small
    Business Association Loan Guarantee programs on per capita income
    growth.

8.  Do differences in tax codes across states affect the amount of
    foreign direct investment? Hines (1996) studied the effects of state
    corporate taxes, along with the ability to apply foreign tax
    credits, on investment from outside the United States
