## Overview

Welcome to Week 1! Our goal this week is to (1) help us sort out our varying technologies and workflows and (2) start reviewing statistics and probability. Basically, this the start of a three-week mini-bootcamp to get us ready for the glorious world of regressions!^[Aside: This unit will pull from lots of resources. Things will be simpler once we get to chapter 4 and onward]


What you should do for this three-week unit depends on your background:

### I took EC170/STAT141 recently and remember some stuff
1. Read through SW, and dig deeper into anything that doesn't look familiar. 
2. Watch the class videos and complete video quizzes
3. Use the Khan Academy to clarify anything you feel a bit fuzzy on. 
4. Make sure you can do the practice problems. 


### Everyone else
1. Start by reviewing the Khan Academy videos 
2. Work through *all* the Khan Academy practice problems. 
3. Watch the class videos  and complete video quizzes
4. Head into the practice problems, and review concepts where you are still stuck.


## Reading Guide for Week 1

**Chapter 2.1-2.3: Review of Probability**

This is the material you should already know,  along with supports from [Khan Academy (<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i>)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/). Remember that you don't need to memorize formulas! *Note that most links take you a direct video, but there are also relevant videos in the accompanying playlist.*


- SW 2.1 Random Variables and Probability Distributions 
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Introduction to random variables and probability distributions variables (playlist)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/random-variables-ap/discrete-random-variables/v/theoretical-probability-distribution-example-tables)
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Mean and standard deviation of random variables (playlist)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/random-variables-ap/xfb5d8e68:mean-standard-deviation-random-variables/v/expected-value-of-a-discrete-random-variable)
   - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Conditional probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap#stats-conditional-probability)
- SW 2.2 Expected Values, Mean, and Variance 
  - You only need a general knowledge of kurtosis and skew. 
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Transforming random variables](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/random-variables-ap/transforming-random-variables/v/impact-of-scaling-and-shifting-random-variables)
- SW 2.3 Two Random Variables 
  - Law of iterated expectations can be skimmed 
	- Make sure youâ€™re good with key concept box 2.3!
