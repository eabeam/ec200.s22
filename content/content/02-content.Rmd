## Overview

Welcome to Week 3! Statistical review continues apace. 

As before, what you should do this final week before the exam depends on your background:

### I took EC170/STAT141 recently and remember some stuff
1. Read through SW, and dig deeper into anything that doesn't look familiar. 
2. Watch the class videos and complete video quiz.
3. Use the Khan Academy to clarify anything you feel a bit fuzzy on. 
4. Make sure you can do the practice problems. 


### Everyone else
1. Start by reviewing the Khan Academy videos 
2. Work through *all* the Khan Academy practice problems. 
3. Watch the class videos and complete video quiz.
4. Head into the practice problems, and review concepts where you are still stuck.


## Reading Guide (Chapter 2)

### SW 2.5 Random Sampling and the Distribution of the Sample Average 
  - [ <i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> What is a sampling distribution?](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/what-is-sampling-distribution/v/introduction-to-sampling-distributions) *(just the one video)*
  
### SW 2.6 Large-sample approximations to sampling distributions
  - *Get that central limit theorem!*
  - [ <i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Central Limit Theorem](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/what-is-sampling-distribution/v/central-limit-theorem)  *(just the one video)*
  - [ <i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Sampling distribution of a sample, part I  mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/what-is-sampling-distribution/v/sampling-distribution-of-the-sample-mean) and [part II](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/what-is-sampling-distribution/v/sampling-distribution-of-the-sample-mean-2) *(just the two videos, with a practice after)*

## Reading Guide (Chapter 3)

This is the material you should know,  along with supports from [Khan Academy (<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i>)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/). Remember that you don't need to memorize formulas! 



### SW 3.1	Estimation of the population mean 
  - Don’t worry too much about BLUE, we’ll come back to it. But make sure you get bias, consistency, and efficiency

### SW 3.2	Hypothesis tests concerning the population mean
  - *KA presents confidence intervals before hypothesis tests, so if following their curruculum, start w/ confidence intervals first*
  -  [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> The idea behind significance tests](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-categorical-proportions/idea-significance-tests/v/idea-behind-hypothesis-testing) 
   -  [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Introduction to confidence intervals](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-quantitative-means/one-sample-t-interval-mean/v/introduction-to-t-statistics)
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Setting up a test for a population mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-quantitative-means/one-sample-t-test-mean/v/writing-hypotheses-for-significance-test-about-means) *(entire playlist)*
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Carrying out a test for a population mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-quantitative-means/xfb5d8e68:carrying-out-test-mean/v/when-to-use-z-or-t-statistics-in-significance-tests) *(entire playlist, except part about TI calculator)*
  

### SW 3.3	Confidence intervals for the population mean
  -  [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Constructing a confidence interval for a population mean](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-quantitative-means/one-sample-t-interval-mean/v/introduction-to-t-statistics)


### SW 3.4 Comparing means from different populations 
**This is covered in updated slides and class, but *not* in the lecture video below)**

  - Only the type of two-sample test we've been practicing - look at difference between two means where the standard deviation is unknown and   you do not assume that they come from the same underlying population distribution. **Make sure you can use formulas 3.19 and 3.20** 
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Testing for the differences of two population means](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/xfb5d8e68:inference-categorical-proportions/idea-significance-tests/v/idea-behind-hypothesis-testing)

### Skip SW 3.5/3.6

### SW 3.7	Scatterplots, the sample covariance, and the sample correlation
  - [<i class="fas fa-tv"> </i> Correlation coefficients](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/bivariate-data-ap/correlation-coefficient-r/v/calculating-correlation-coefficient-r)
