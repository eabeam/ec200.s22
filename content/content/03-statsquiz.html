<div id="what-should-i-know" class="section level2">
<h2>What should I know?</h2>
<p>Make sure you are comfortable with the material chapter guides from <a href="../01-content">Week 1</a>, <a href="../02-content">Week 2</a>, and <a href="../03-content">Week 3</a>. What does comfortable mean? That youâ€™re familiar with definitions and terminology, and that you can work through problems at the level of PS1 (solutions on <a href="http://bb.uvm.edu">Blackboard</a>).</p>
<p>There will not be a Stata component to the exam.</p>
</div>
<div id="i-need-more-practice" class="section level2">
<h2>I need more practice!</h2>
<p>I recommend the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Odd-numbered problems from Stock and Watson - solutions are available <a href="../../bonus/general-resources">here</a></li>
<li><a href="#practice-exam">Practice exam</a></li>
<li><a href="#inclass-practice">In-class practice</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-structure-of-the-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the structure of the exam?</h2>
<p>The exam will be a lot like a math exam - solving some problems and showing your work. I would expect about 3 multi-part questions. There may be some questions that involve definitions and/or true-false.</p>
<p>The exam is open book with a calculator allowed.</p>
<p>What is allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper notes</li>
<li>Textbook</li>
<li>Calculator (basic, scientific, graphing)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not allowed?</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Phone</del></li>
<li><del>Tablet</del></li>
<li><del>Laptop</del></li>
</ul>
<!---### How do I submit? 
Work through on paper, then scan a copy and upload it onto Blackboard. Please use something like [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) so that you can submit **just one file in pdf form**. In the past, I've found that uploading photos yields huge files that are difficult to grade.

#### Details: 

What should you make sure you include? 

 - Just one file per person 
 - PDF version - review in advance to make sure the text is readable
 - Make sure your answers are numbered, but you don't need to write out the questions
 - Please make sure pages are in order
 - **YOU MUST SHOW YOUR WORK** for full credit.

### Practice exam! (For logisitics)

Just to make sure we're feeling good about logistics, I'll post a "practice exam" on Blackboard that will go live at **3:30pm on Friday, September 18** (after our optional meet up) with one question. You can download it, work through the problem, scan it and upload your exam.  It will be available until **11:59 pm Sunday.**

I'll review your submission and make sure there aren't any problems with viewing your work.  

Completion of the practice exam will be worth 2 points toward the exam (regardless of the accuracy of your answer).

 

## Practice 

On Friday, I'll release an optional "practice" lock-down exam. It will have one practice questions, so we can all experience the glory of online testing. If you complete the pratice lock-down exam, you will earn 2 points toward the exam.
