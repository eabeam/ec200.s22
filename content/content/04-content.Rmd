## Overview

Welcome to Week 4! We are proceeding boldly into the world of **linear regression.** We're starting by looking into the *linear* relationship between two variables. 

What we *won't* be doing is controlling for other factors, nor conducting statistical inference. We won't be looking at non-linear relationships yet either! Bah. 

Rather, we're going to dive deep into what it means to look at how we can find a good estimate - nay, the best estimate! - of the relatonship between some $X$ and some $Y$.


This is where *Stock and Watson* really start to shine. I highly recommend basking in their expertise and conversational style. 

## Reading Guide

**Chapter 4: Linear Regression with One Regressor**

**SW 4.1** - The Linear Regression Model 

This section is packed w/ good intuition and **bolded** vocabulary. Make sure you know it! 

**SW 4.2** - Estimating the Coefficient of the Linear Regression Model? 

You should be able to estimate linear regression coefficients by hand :sleepy:. 

**SW 4.3** Measures of Fit

Know how to use and interpret $R^2$, $ESS$, $TSS$, $SSR$ and $SER$. You will also need to know how to find these from raw Stata output as well. 

**SW 4.4** Least Squares Assumptions 

Known and understand the three least squares assumptions 

**SW 4.5**  Sampling Distribution of the OLS

Discuss unbiasedness of estimators and effects of larger vs. smaller sample sizes on standard errors. We won't calculate standard errors by hand. 


## Note on causality 

At this stage, we are thinking about *making good model* of data, but not necessarily the **data generating process** behind that data. When we use the framing of an **independent** and **dependent** variables, it's tempting to think that we're examining whether the **independent** variable *causes* the **dependent** variable.

At this point in the course, we're looking at associations which *could* be causal ... or they could not be! 

If you want to dig deeper, check out this great guide from EGAP:[10 things to know about causal inference](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-causal-inference/).

## In-class exercise

Consider a dataset on births to women in the United States. Two
variables of interest are infant birth weight in ounces (`bwght`), and
the average number of cigarettes the mother smoked per day during
pregnancy (`cigs`). The following simple regression was estimated using
data on 1,388 births.

      Source |       SS           df       MS      Number of obs   =     1,388
    -------------+----------------------------------   F(1, 1386)      =     32.24
       Model |  13060.4194         1  13060.4194   Prob > F        =    0.0000
    Residual |    561551.3     1,386  405.159668   R-squared       =    0.0227
    -------------+----------------------------------   Adj R-squared   =    0.0220
       Total |   574611.72     1,387  414.283864   Root MSE        =    20.129

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       bwght |      Coef.   Std. Err.      t    P>|t|     [95% Conf. Interval]
    -------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
        cigs |  -.5137721   .0904909    -5.68   0.000    -.6912861   -.3362581
       _cons |   119.7719   .5723407   209.27   0.000     118.6492    120.8946
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These results can also be written in the following way:

$$\widehat{bwght} = 119.77 - 0.514 cigs$$

1.  What is the dependent variable? What is the independent variable?

2.  Write, in words, what the interpretation of $0.514$ is.

3.  What is the predicted birth weight among mothers who do not smoke?
    What about when $cigs=20$ (one pack per day)? Comment on the
    difference.

4.  Consider Prof. Beam, whose mother "cut back" to 10 cigarettes per
    day (it was the 80s) and was born weighing 9lb, 15 oz. What is her
    residual?

5.  Find $R^2$ in the raw regression output. What does it tell us?

6.  Are any least squares assumptions likely to be violated? Explain.

7.  Does this simple regression necessarily capture a causal
    relationship between the child's birth weight and the mother's
    smoking habits? Explain.
