## Overview

As we carry on into the wonderful world of statistical inference, expect flashbacks of our statistics review. That's what the review was for! It's all coming together  :relieved:.

## Reading Guide

**Chapter 5: Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals**

**SW 5.1**	Testing Hypotheses About One of the Regression Coefficients

This is very important stuff. Again, donâ€™t worry about calculating the variance of a beta coefficient by hand. However, note how similar this is to our hypothesis testing in Chapter 3!

**SW 5.2**	Confidence intervals for a regression coefficient

**SW 5.3**	Regression when X is a binary variable 

We are going to use this ALL THE TIME. 

**SW 5.4**	Heteroskedasticity and homoskedasticity 


```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1316528345224343552')
```


Drop "heteroskedasticity" into any conversation and you're sure to delight. Just one more benefit of EC200. 
The examples and implications of heteroskedasticity are important. 

And, now you'll know to add `, robust` to all your Stata regressions. (*Quick, someone tell Nate Silver!*)

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1273493646969647105')
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1274901353563934726')
```



**SW 5.5**	Theoretical foundations of OLS

Know the Gauss-Markov theorem and related assumptions. Skip "regression estimators other than OLS." The appendix contains a proof of the Gauss-Markov theorm, but we will not cover that.

~~**SW 5.6**~~ Skip this section!

**SW 5.7**	Conclusion

For the good times.
