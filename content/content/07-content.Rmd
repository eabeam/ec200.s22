## Overview

And now, we're back to hypothesis testing. The big thing we're going to learn about is testing more complicated hypotheses, like whether two coefficients are equal, and whether a whole bunch of coefficients equal zero. 


## Reading Guide

#### **Chapter 7: Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals with Multiple Regressions**

#### **SW 7.1** Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals for a Single Coefficient

Here, we want to test hypothesis of this form: $H_0: \beta_j = \beta_{j,0}$ vs. $H_a: \beta_j \neq \beta_{j,0}$

If you want another take on hypothesis testing with regression coefficients, go ahead and read this. I'm not going to cover this in class, because we've hit this in Chapter 5. 


#### **SW 7.2** Tests of Joint Hypotheses

Here, we test hypothesis with lots of coefficients, of this form: $H_0: \beta_j = \beta_{j,0},  \beta_m = \beta_{m,0}, ...$, for $q$ restrictions, vs $H_a$: any one of those $q$ restrictions does not hold.

#### **SW 7.3** Testing Single Restrictions Involving Multiple Coefficients

Here, we test one restriction, but with multiple coefficients, like this: $H_0: \beta_j = \beta_m$ vs. $H_a: \beta_j \neq \beta_m$



#### That's it! 

7.5 is a good review of things we've already discussed, and 7.6 walk us through an example. I encourage you to read them, but not mandatory. And we're skipping 7.4
