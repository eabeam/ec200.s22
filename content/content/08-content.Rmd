## Overview

Let's make regressions faaaancy, with three new friends: **polynomials**, **logarithms**, and **interactions**! 

## Reading Guide

#### **Chapter 8: Nonlinear Regression Functions**

#### **SW 8.1** A General Strategy for Modeling Nonlinear Regression Functons

Key takeaway here - think about the economic theory and its application to determine the best approach to modeling! 


#### **SW 8.2** Nonlinear Functions of a Single Independent Variable 

Polynomials and logs. Note that this section includes only 3 ways of setting up equations: level-level, log-log, log-level. We'll also cover level-log, because, why not?

#### **SW 8.3** Interactions Between Independent Variables

Three types of interactions you should know: 

1. Binary-binary
2. Continuous-binary
3. Contnuous-continuous

## Videos

This video talks us through polynomial and logarithmic regressions. We will do interactions (SW 8.3) entirely in class. Don't forget to complete [VQ8 on Blackboard!](https://blackboard.uvm.edu)
