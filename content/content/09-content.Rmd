## Overview

Two big picture ideas: **internal validity** and **external validity**. Specifically, we're going to talk a little more about omitted variable bias, a lot about measurement error, and a little bit about simultaneity! 
## Reading Guide

#### **Chapter 9: Assessing Studies Based on Multiple Regression**

#### **SW 9.1** Internal and External Validity 

Get those definitions, and threats to external validity 

#### **SW 9.2** Threats to Internal Validity of Multiple Regression Analysis 

Five big threats. And how to handle them. 

#### **SW 9.3** Internal and External Validity When the Regression is Used for Forcasting

Optional  - worth giving some thought 


#### **SW 9.4** Example: Test Score and Class Size

No new content, but this is a really good walk-through of the 9.1 and 9.2 content.
