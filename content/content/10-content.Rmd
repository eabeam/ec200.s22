## Overview

We've complained a lot about challenges to obtaining causal estimation. Now, let's *do* something about it! :strong:

Note that this week we're covering difference-in-differences estimation - it's not actually in Chapter 10^[Check out SW13.4 if you want to be precise.], but it fits here nicely. 

## Reading Guide

#### **Chapter 10: Regression with Panel Data**

#### **SW 10.1** Panel data

Make sure you know the difference between **cross-sectional**, **time-series**, and **panel** data. Also, what does it mean to be **balanced**?

#### **SW 10.2** Panel data with two time periods: "Before and after" comparisons

We can control for variables that are *constant* over time by differencing them out. Do you understand how this works? 

#### **SW 10.3** Fixed effects regression

Instead of differencing, let's include a bunch of entity-specific intercepts. What are we doing, why does it work? When is it like the before-after comparisons from before? 

#### **SW 10.4** Regression with time fixed effects

Just like we can control for unit-specific factors that remain constant over time, we can also control for factors that vary over time but are constant across units with **time fixed effects**. Neat! 

Can we include both entity- *and* time-specific fixed effetcst? You bet we can! 

#### **SW 10.5** The fixed effects regression assumptions and standard errors for fixed effects regressions

How do our LS assumptions change when we move to panel data? 

#### **SW ??** Difference-in-differences estimation 

Set up and interpret difference-in-differences estimation. There's a decent discussion in **SW13.4**, but I think it's more appropriate to cover it here, since it's so closely linked to panel data.
