Before each week, review the relevant materials here alongside the textbook before coming to class. For nearly all weeks, there are accompanying leture videos. Some videos are optional, and some videos are mandatory (see the [schedule](../schedule)). 

For the mandatory videos, make sure to also take the video quiz available on [Blackboard](http://bb.uvm.edu) before class!
