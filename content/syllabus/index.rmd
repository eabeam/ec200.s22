# Course description {#course-description .unnumbered}

**Credits: 3**

This course will provide a theoretical and practical background in basic
econometric techniques. We will review probability and statistics before
covering classical linear regression with two or more variables,
estimation and hypothesis testing, and violations of classical
assumptions. EC200 is a challenging course. If you are not interested in
taking a challenging course, you should take a different course. The
prerequisites are EC170, EC171, and EC172.

The course will combine lectures, discussion, and lots of practice.
Learning econometrics requires a healthy blend of theory and practice,
so you will complete problem sets throughout the semester, and you will
design and and write a short research paper that applies some of the
techniques we've learned about to real-world data. We won't have enough
course time to cover all the Stata preparation you'll need, but I'll
cover the basics and you'll have to rely on other resources to figure
out the rest.

# Learning objectives:  {#learning-objectives .unnumbered}

-   To understand and apply foundational tools in econometric theory

-   To use econometric tools and statistical packages (Stata) to analyze
    real-world data and interpret findings

-   To formulate, assess, and answer economic questions by selecting and
    applying appropriate econometric techniques

# Required materials  {#required-materials .unnumbered}

-   **Textbook:** Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson. *Introduction to
    Econometrics*, 3rd edition (updated), Pearson. ISBN-13:
    978-0-13-348687-2.

    -   **I recommend buying cheaper used copies online ($\sim$ \$20)** I am using the "updated"         edition. International is fine, but your problems/solutions may differ from mine. For             exercises, I will provide the full text of problems.

    -   There is a newer, 4th edition available. Do not purchase this!

    -   We are **not** using any digital Pearson tools.

-   **Stata**: We will use Stata extensively in this course, including
    outside of class. It is compatible with Windows/MacOS/Linux. You
    should download a copy at <https://www.uvm.edu/software/>. Note that
    there is a link to a pdf file that contains the licensing
    information.

# Course components {#course-components .unnumbered}

## Embarking on the week {#class-meetings-m .unnumbered}

If you come into class without preparing, things will feel bad! Check the calendar to see what you need to do. Before we start on a new unit, you should always read the associated chapters. There is usually an assigned or optional lecture video to get your prepared. If assigned, you'll also need to earn an 80% on that week's lecture quiz. 

Our class meetings will be a combination of lecture, practice, and labs. 

We will not have labs every week, but when we do, they will be on Wednesdays. During labs you should bring a laptop to class. I will demo some concepts and commands and give you time to practice. A final version of your [lab](/assignment#labs) will be due before the next **Wednesday** class.


# Deadlines  {#deadlines-and-extensions .unnumbered}

-   All deadlines are at 2:20pm, and all assignments are due on Blackboard.

-   As a general rule, problem sets are due on Fridays at 2:20pm. Video
    quizzes are usually due Mondays, and final labs are due on Wednesdays at 2:20pm.

-   Please submit all assignments through Blackboard. If you encounter
    technical issues, e-mail is a fine last resort.

-   Late problem sets and labs will be penalized 10 percentage points per day. Late video quizzes are not accepted.

-   Regarding **research papers elements *only***, I have an *"extensions for all"* policy
  - If you need an extension, request it by e-mail **before** the deadline and provide a proposed new deadline. 
  - Some assignments build on previous ones, so be careful when requesting that you don't put       yourself in a tricky position. I don't need to know why you need the extension. 
  - If you exceed your revised deadline (or you request an extension *after* the due date), then     I will start applying the 10 percentage point deduction per day. 


# Class Engagement and attendance {#class-engagement-and-attendance .unnumbered}

This is a challenging course, and you'll get the most out of it if you
engage with the material both during and outside of class. You are
responsible for finding a classmate or checking Blackboard for any
content you may miss during class. 


# Grading {#grading .unnumbered}

## Assignment weights {#assignment-weights .unnumbered}

|    Assignment    |   Percent
| :------------- | :----------: | 
| Lecture video quizzes                    |           5%    |
| Labs                                  |        10%   |
| Problem sets                           |       10%   |
| Exams (3 quizzes at 5%, 15%, 15%)       |      35%   |
| Research paper                           |     40%   |

*I will drop your lowest lecture quiz*

## Grading distribution {#grading-distribution .unnumbered}

| Range       | Grade  
| :------------- | :----------: | 
|  93.0 - 100.0| A/A+   | 
| 90.0 - 92.99   | A-|
|  87.0 - 89.99 | B+|
 |83.0 - 86.99  | B|
 |80.0 - 82.99   |B-| 
|  77.0 - 79.99   |C+|
 | 73.0 - 76.99   |C|
  | 70.0 - 72.99   |C-|
   | 67.0 - 69.99   |D+|
    |     63.0 - 66.99|   D|
     |        $<$ 60.0 |      F|


-   I determine grades by a threshold - 93.01 is an A, and 92.97 is an
    A-. In cases of very near misses of higher grades, however, I will
    take into account class participation/attendance.

-   I will never curve quizzes down, but I may curve them up if the
    median grade is less than a B-.

# Quizzes {#quizzes .unnumbered}


There are two unit exams (15% each) and one stats exam (5%). All quizzes are in-class and open note, but computers/tablets/phones are not permitted. 

Quizzes are not explicitly cumulative, but you'll need to master skills from earlier
chapters to tackle the newer material.

# FAQ {#frequently-asked-questions .unnumbered}


1.  *I don't remember ANYTHING from statistics. Will I be able to pass
    this class?* The stronger your stats background, the more useful
    you'll find this class. Whether or not you can recall the formula
    for a one-sample hypothesis test should have no bearing on your
    ability to succeed (you can always look it up!) But to have a sense
    of what big concepts mean will be very important. We'll
    review together at the beginning of the term.

1.  *I am sick and need to miss class. Will I lose points? Do I need to
    tell you?* You don't need to let me know if you will be missing
    class. If you need an extension, though, I will need to know that in
    advance of the deadline.

1.  *Do I really need to buy a textbook?* Yes. 3rd (updated edition),
    used. 
    
1.  Do I need a computer for this class? You will need a computer for any work with Stata. I *think* there is a way to get Stata to run on a Chromebook, but I can provide you with roughly zero technical support for setting that up!

<!-- 1.  *My computer is broken/missing/on fire and I cannot submit my 
    assignment on time!* Give me a heads up prior to the deadline, and
    we can work out an extension.
    --> 

1. *Can I use open-source, glorious, R?* Sure. But I have many caveats and warnings. (1) You will need to to be comfortable reading and interpreting Stata output in order to be successful on exams. (2) I will be teaching in Stata exclusively, and the technical support I will be able to provide is limited. 

<!-- 1.  *Can I use another software program (i.e. Excel, SPSS, EViews, R, -->
<!--     Gretl, etc.)?* In special cases, maybe. Talk to me first if you have -->
<!--     a compelling reason why you would like to use another program. It needs to be something with replicable code (ie R, not Excel). I -->
<!--     won't be able to provide assistance with problem sets or your -->
<!--     project if you decide not to use Stata, and you will still be -->
<!--     responsible for any Stata-related questions that come up on quizzes. -->
