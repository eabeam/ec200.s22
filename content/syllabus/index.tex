\textbf{Credits: 3}

This course will provide a theoretical and practical background in basic
econometric techniques. We will review probability and statistics before
covering classical linear regression with two or more variables,
estimation and hypothesis testing, and violations of classical
assumptions. EC200 is a challenging course. If you are not interested in
taking a challenging course, you should take a different course. The
prerequisites are EC170, EC171, and EC172.

The course will combine lectures, discussion, and lots of practice.
Learning econometrics requires a healthy blend of theory and practice,
so you will complete problem sets throughout the semester, and you will
design and and write a short research paper that applies some of the
techniques we've learned about to real-world data. We won't have enough
course time to cover all the Stata preparation you'll need, but I'll
cover the basics and you'll have to rely on other resources to figure
out the rest.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section*{Learning objectives:}\label{learning-objectives}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Learning objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To understand and apply foundational tools in econometric theory
\item
  To use econometric tools and statistical packages (Stata) to analyze
  real-world data and interpret findings
\item
  To formulate, assess, and answer economic questions by selecting and
  applying appropriate econometric techniques
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section*{Required materials}\label{required-materials}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Required materials}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Textbook:} Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson.
  \emph{Introduction to Econometrics}, 3rd edition (updated), Pearson.
  ISBN-13: 978-0-13-348687-2.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{I recommend buying cheaper used copies online (\(\sim\)
    \$20)} I am using the ``updated'' edition. International is fine,
    but your problems/solutions may differ from mine. For exercises, I
    will provide the full text of problems.
  \item
    There is a newer, 4th edition available. Do not purchase this!
  \item
    We are \textbf{not} using any digital Pearson tools.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Stata}: We will use Stata extensively in this course,
  including outside of class. It is compatible with Windows/MacOS/Linux.
  You should download a copy at \url{https://www.uvm.edu/software/}.
  Note that there is a link to a pdf file that contains the licensing
  information.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Embarking on the week}

If you come into class without preparing, things will feel bad! Check
the calendar to see what you need to do. Before we start on a new unit,
you should always read the associated chapters. There is usually an
assigned or optional lecture video to get your prepared. If assigned,
you'll also need to earn an 80\% on that week's lecture quiz.

Our class meetings will be a combination of lecture, practice, and labs.

We will not have labs every week, but when we do, they will be on
Wednesdays. During labs you should bring a laptop to class. I will demo
some concepts and commands and give you time to practice. A final
version of your \href{/assignment\#labs}{lab} will be due one week
later.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Deadlines}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With the exception of a handful of research paper assignments,
  deadlines are at \textbf{2:50pm}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    As a general rule, problem sets are due on Thursdays at 2:50pm.
    Video quizzes are usually due Tuesdays, and final labs bounce around
    depending on the schedule.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Please submit all assignments through Blackboard. If you encounter
  technical issues, e-mail is a fine last resort.
\item
  Late problem sets and labs will be penalized 10\% per day. Late video
  quizzes are not accepted.
\item
  Regarding \textbf{research papers intermediate elements \emph{only}},
  I have an \emph{``extensions for all''} policy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you need an extension, request it by e-mail \textbf{before} the
    deadline and provide a proposed new deadline.
  \item
    Some assignments build on previous ones, so be careful when
    requesting that you don't put yourself in a tricky position. I don't
    need to know why you need the extension.
  \item
    If you exceed your revised deadline (or you request an extension
    \emph{after} the due date), then I will start applying the 10\%
    deduction per day.
  \item
    This does not apply to the final submission, which remains fixed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This is a challenging course, and you'll get the most out of it if you
engage with the material both during and outside of class. You are
responsible for finding a classmate or checking Blackboard for any
content you may miss during class.

\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  I determine grades by a threshold - 93.01 is an A, and 92.97 is an A-.
  In cases of very near misses of higher grades, however, I will take
  into account class participation/attendance.
\item
  I will never curve quizzes down, but I may curve them up if the median
  grade is less than a B-.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\section*{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Quizzes}

There are two unit exams (15\% each) and one stats exam (5\%). All exams
are in-class and open note, but computers/tablets/phones are not
permitted.

Quizzes are not explicitly cumulative, but you'll need to master skills
from earlier chapters to tackle the newer material.

\hypertarget{frequently-asked-questions}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{FAQ}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{I don't remember ANYTHING from statistics. Will I be able to
  pass this class?} The stronger your stats background, the more useful
  you'll find this class. Whether or not you can recall the formula for
  a one-sample hypothesis test should have no bearing on your ability to
  succeed (you can always look it up!) But to have a sense of what big
  concepts mean will be very important. We'll review together at the
  beginning of the term.
\item
  \emph{I am sick and need to miss class. Will I lose points? Do I need
  to tell you?} You don't need to let me know if you will be missing
  class. If you need an extension, though, I will need to know that in
  advance of the deadline.
\item
  \emph{Do I really need to buy a textbook?} Yes. 3rd (updated edition),
  used.
\item
  Do I need a computer for this class? You will need a computer for any
  work with Stata. I \emph{think} there is a way to get Stata to run on
  a Chromebook, but I can provide you with roughly zero technical
  support for setting that up!
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Can I use open-source, glorious, R?} Sure. But I have many
  caveats and warnings. (1) You will need to to be comfortable reading
  and interpreting Stata output in order to be successful on exams. (2)
  I will be teaching in Stata exclusively, and the technical support I
  will be able to provide is limited.
