*Fall 2020 will be a strange semester. My operating principle is that we
are all trying our best. I will work to accommodate personal
emergencies, unpredictable schedules, general chaos as best I can.*

# Course Description {#course-description .unnumbered}

This course will provide a theoretical and practical background in basic
econometric techniques. We will review probability and statistics before
covering classical linear regression with two or more variables,
estimation and hypothesis testing, and violations of classical
assumptions. EC200 is a challenging course. If you are not interested in
taking a challenging course, you should take a different course. The
prerequisites are EC170, EC171, and EC172.

The course will combine lectures, discussion, and lots of practice.
Learning econometrics requires a healthy blend of theory and practice,
so you will complete problem sets throughout the semester, and you will
design and and write a short research paper that applies some of the
techniques we've learned about to real-world data. We won't have enough
course time to cover all the Stata preparation you'll need, but I'll
cover the basics and you'll have to rely on other resources to figure
out the rest.

# Learning Objectives:  {#learning-objectives .unnumbered}


-   To understand and apply foundational tools in econometric theory

-   To use econometric tools and statistical packages (Stata) to analyze
    real-world data and interpret findings

-   To formulate, assess, and answer economic questions by selecting and
    applying appropriate econometric techniques

# Required Materials  {#required-materials .unnumbered}


-   **Textbook:** Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson. *Introduction to
    Econometrics*, 3rd edition (updated), Pearson. ISBN-13:
    978-0-13-348687-2.

    -   **I recommend buying cheaper used copies online ($\sim$ \$20)**,
        international is fine. There is a 3rd edition that is "updated"
        and one that is not. I am using the "updated" edition. If you
        buy the one that is not "updated," your problem numbers will be
        off.

    -   There is a newer, 4th edition available. Do not purchase this!

    -   We are **not** using any of the digital Pearson tools.

-   **Stata**: We will use Stata extensively in this course, including
    outside of class. It is compatible with Windows/MacOS/Linux. You
    should download a copy at <https://www.uvm.edu/software/>. Note that
    there is a link to a pdf file that contains the licensing
    information.

-   **MS Teams** All class sessions will take place on Teams.

# Course components {#course-components .unnumbered}

## Video lectures {#video-lectures .unnumbered}

I will post a series of videos each Friday night, with accompanying
slides. You can find all these on Blackboard. You should review these
and take a short quiz on Blackboard before coming to class on Monday.

After reviewing, you'll take a **video quiz** on Blackboard. You need an 80\% for credit, and you can make unlimited attempts. These must be completed before Monday class. 

## Class meetings (M) {#class-meetings-m .unnumbered}

Live class meetings. I will review key concepts, we'll work through some
problems.


## Stata labs (W) {#stata-labs-w .unnumbered}

Live class meetings. I will demonstrate some Stata techniques and you'll
have time to practice. You'll submit your work in progress before the end of class. 

A final version of your lab will be due before the next Monday class.

## Q&A (F) {#qa-f .unnumbered}

Live class time (optional) to review lab questions, homework questions,
any questions!

*All class sessions will be recorded and available on Blackboard/Teams.*

# Deadlines and extensions {#deadlines-and-extensions .unnumbered}

-   All deadlines are at 2:20pm.

-   As a general rule, problem sets are due on Fridays at 2:20pm. Video
    quizzes and final labs are due on Mondays at 2:20pm.

-   Please submit all assignments through Blackboard. If you encounter
    technical issues, e-mail is a fine last resort.

-   I have an "**extensions for all**" policy for all assignments. If
    you need an extension, you should request it by e-mail **before**
    the deadline. Provide (a) your work so far (if applicable)
    and (b) a proposed new deadline. Some assignments build on previous
    ones, so be careful when requesting that you don't put yourself in a
    tricky position. I don't need to know why you need the extension.


# Class Engagement and Attendance {#class-engagement-and-attendance .unnumbered}

This is a challenging course, and you'll get the most out of it if you
engage with the material both during and outside of class. You are
responsible for finding a classmate or checking Blackboard for any
content you may miss during class. 

<!---I don't take attendance explicitly,
but note that lab grades can only be submitted if you attend class.

# Grading {#grading .unnumbered}

## Assignment weights {##assignment-weights .unnumbered}

|    Assignment    |   Percent
| :------------- | :----------: | 
| Lecture quizzes                    |           5%    |
| Labs                                  |        10%   |
| Problem sets                           |       10%   |
| Unit quizzes (3 quizzes at 5%, 15%, 15%)|      35%   |
|Research paper                           |     40%   |

*I will drop your lowest lecture quiz, lab, and problem set.*

## Grading distribution {##grading-distribution .unnumbered}

| Range       | Grade  
| :------------- | :----------: | 
|  93.0 - 100.0| A/A+   | 
| 90.0 - 92.99   | A-|
|  87.0 - 89.99 | B+|
 |83.0 - 86.99  | B|
 |80.0 - 82.99   |B-| 
|  77.0 - 79.99   |C+|
 | 73.0 - 76.99   |C|
  | 70.0 - 72.99   |C-|
   | 67.0 - 69.99   |D+|
    |     63.0 - 66.99|   D|
     |        $<$ 60.0 |      F|


-   I determine grades by a threshold - 93.01 is an A, and 92.97 is an
    A-. In cases of very near misses of higher grades, however, I will
    take into account class participation/attendance.

-   I will never curve quizzes down, but I may curve them up if the
    median grade is less than a B-.

## Quizzes {#quizzes .unnumbered}


There are two unit quizzes (15% each) and one stats quiz (5%). All
quizzes are open book. You should not collaborate. Quizzes are not
explicitly cumulative, but you'll need to master skills from earlier
chapters to tackle the newer material.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#frequently-asked-questions .unnumbered}


1.  *I don't remember ANYTHING from statistics. Will I be able to pass
    this class?* The stronger your stats background, the more useful
    you'll find this class. Whether or not you can recall the formula
    for a one-sample hypothesis test should have no bearing on your
    ability to succeed (you can always look it up!) But to have a sense
    of what big concepts mean will be very important. We'll
    review together at the beginning of the term.

2.  *I am sick and need to miss class. Will I lose points? Do I need to
    tell you?* You don't need to let me know if you will be missing
    class. If you need an extension,though, I will need to know that in
    advance of the deadline.

3.  *Do I really need to buy a textbook?* Yes. 3rd (updated edition),
    used.

4.  *My computer is broken/missing/on fire and I cannot submit my
    assignment on time!* Give me a heads up prior to the deadline, and
    we can work out an extension.

5.  *Can I use another software program (i.e. Excel, SPSS, EViews, R,
    Gretl, etc.)?* In special cases, maybe. Talk to me first if you have
    a compelling reason why you would like to use another program. I
    won't be able to provide assistance with problem sets or your
    project if you decide not to use Stata, and you will still be
    responsible for any Stata-related questions that come up on quizzes.

## I am in college and having some problems {#i-am-in-college-and-having-some-problems .unnumbered}

Sometimes life goes bananas. Or awful things happen. This is so very,
very common. You are not alone, and the university has support for you.

### I have a nasty cold {#i-have-a-nasty-cold .unnumbered}


Get better, get some sleep. Skip class and rest. (Unless it's an exam;
you should probably come and bring a lot of tissues.) This is why you
can drop a few assignments. I don't need to know about this, and I won't
excuse your absences.

### Oh no, it's actually pneumonia (aka I am REALLY SICK or REALLY HURT) {#oh-no-its-actually-pneumonia-aka-i-am-really-sick-or-really-hurt .unnumbered}


Please reach out to student services at your college. They will help
you! A very common thing that happens is that you document your medical
emergency w/ the Dean's Office, and they contact all your professors for
you. Then, your professors can make accommodations to help you. You can
reach out to me before or after you get in touch with the Dean's office,
and I'm happy to work through hypotheticals (ie, I have a concussion and
I can't decide whether to take the next quiz).

### I'm experiencing some serious family emergencies {#im-experiencing-some-serious-family-emergencies .unnumbered}


Same as above, reach out to student services through your college. They
are here to help you.

### My mental health is not so good {#my-mental-health-is-not-so-good .unnumbered}


Please consider reaching out to CAPS
(<https://www.uvm.edu/health/CAPS>). They are free! If you need a
same-day appointment, tell them that, and they will help you right away.
If you're worried your mental health is going to affect your school
performance, student services can help your arrange accommodations with
your professors--this is very common!

## I'm experiencing food/housing insecurity {#im-experiencing-foodhousing-insecurity .unnumbered}


If you are facing problems securing your food or housing and think this
may affect your school performance, I strongly encourage you to contact
student services as well. You can also notify me if you feel
comfortable, so that I can provide any resources/accommodations if
needed.

 # Student Responsibilities and Rights {#student-responsibilities-and-rights .unnumbered}


**Student learning accommodations** In keeping with University policy,
any student with a documented disability interested in utilizing
accommodations should contact ACCESS, the office of Disability Services
on campus. ACCESS works with students to create reasonable and
appropriate accommodations via an accommodation letter to their
professors as early as possible each semester.
